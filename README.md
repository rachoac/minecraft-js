# Minecraft JS Integration

```
cd client
./start.sh <minecraftuser> <minecraft js server> <secretkey>

```

... then start adding (pre-es5) .js scripts into the specified folder!

In minecraft, you can run `current.js` using this command:

`/js run()`

You can run a named script by specifying its name in the argument:

`/js run("myotherscript.js")`
